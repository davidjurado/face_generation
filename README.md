## Face Generation

This repository corresponds to my submission of the four project from the Deep Learning nanodegree program from [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch).

I trained two diferent GANs that geneate faces of different sizes:

* [32x32](https://github.com/davidjurado/face_generation/blob/master/dlnd_face_generation_32.ipynb).
* [64x64](https://github.com/davidjurado/face_generation/blob/master/dlnd_face_generation_64.ipynb).

### Results for GAN 32x32
