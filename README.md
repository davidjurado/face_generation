# Face Generation

This repository corresponds to my submission of the fourth project from the Deep Learning Nanodegree program from [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch).

I trained two different GANs that generate faces of different sizes:

* [32x32](https://github.com/davidjurado/face_generation/blob/master/dlnd_face_generation_32.ipynb).
* [64x64](https://github.com/davidjurado/face_generation/blob/master/dlnd_face_generation_64.ipynb).
